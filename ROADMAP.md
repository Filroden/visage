# v2.0.0

* Data model changes and UI to token/actor-level visages to include new flipX and flipY data? Migration script needed?
* CSS cleanup - lots of duplication between v2 additions and original css that need deconflicting and, ideally, re-using rather than repeating
* Add instant preview of Visage in Global Visage Editor
* Should Global Visages stack?
* What do tags do?
* How to improve UX for categories?
